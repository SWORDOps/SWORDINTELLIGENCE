# SWORD Intelligence

**Independent private intelligence firm specializing in Web3 and cyber threats.**

> Adversaries don't play fair. Nor do we,except the laws on our side and im a patient man...hiding a very impatient one so we get shit done.

## 🎯 Mission

SWORD Intelligence helps funds, founders, enterprises, and government clients prevent loss, hunt threat actors, and respond to high-stakes incidents across Web3 and traditional cyber infrastructure.

### Core Focus Areas

- **Threat Actor Hunter**: I will find your target,i will dissect their life,TTP's and ssomehow become their best friend right up until the door gets kicked down...no target too much give the right pay.
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: APT tracking, nation-state operations, infrastructure analysis , focus on APT-41 in particular they seem to be very fond of me even burnt 11 0days trying to hit me.
- **Counter-Narcotics Intelligence**: Fighting synthetic opioid supply chains and other components of the chemical warfare PRC program..at the same time i liase with chinese labs encouraging safer drugs.
- **Web3 & Crypto Crime**:asset tracking and detainment given the right budget ill do it myself, ransomware negotiator andasset recovery , sanctioned red team ops all the way up to nation state level with the paperwork.
- **Executive Protection**: UHNWI and C-suite cyber security (OPSEC, identity fragmentation , cybersecurity)...having had my own identiy and full passport etc leaked by the PRC i know how to handle this.
- **Bespoke Services**: Variety of services on inquiry from logistics,laboratory design to private jet charter just ask...maybe i can even get you on a phone call with john mcaffee for your virus problem who knows.
